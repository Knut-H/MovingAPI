Error with JSON trying to send an object with an Include
JsonException: A possible object cycle was detected which is not supported. This can either be due to a 
cycle or if the object depth is larger than the maximum allowed depth of 32.
System.Text.Json.ThrowHelper.ThrowInvalidOperationException_SerializerCycleDetected(int maxDepth)

This was solved by installing a new NuGet package
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson
as well as adding it as a service in the startup file.
